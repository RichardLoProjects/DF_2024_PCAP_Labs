For generators, once an element is called, it gets erased (or rather emptied) - think of them like containers. So when we first run `gen.__next__()` calling the next element, we pop out 0 (the first element in the list). We call it again, popping the next element, i.e. 1. Currently, our generator is now (2,3,4,5). The `lst` we create will pop out 3 consecutive iterations from our generator, meaning [2,3,4] - which is the correct answer.\n",

From our list, the only non-iterable is 9 (an integer); all the rest (string, list and tuple respectively) are iterables. So the mapped list is ['ku'*2, 9**2, [3,8,3]*2, (2,)*2] which is equal to `['kuku', 81, [3,8,3,3,8,3], (2,2)]`. From these elements we only pick the ones that match the filter's target iterable - which as we can see is only 'kuku'; so the length of our list is 1.\n",
